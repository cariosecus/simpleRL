 A simple Roguelike engine, using Python and the tcod modules. Based on the revised Roguelike tutorial: [Roguelike Tutorials](http://www.rogueliketutorials.com/)

## Playing the Game
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/cariosecus/simpleRL/releases) and download the version you want to try, according to your OS.

## Editing the Code
First, you will need Python. Download [**Python 3.7.4**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/) for your operative system (Windows and OSX; For Linux, use ***sudo apt-get install python 3.7***). Then, using the command line/terminal, go to the folder where you have the downloaded **simpleRL** files and run ***pip install -r requirements.txt*** to install all dependencies and modules. Then just open the files on your favourite Python IDE and edit away! If you don't have an IDE, you can use GitHub's [**Atom**](https://atom.io/).
